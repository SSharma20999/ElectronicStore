# ElectronicStore
Project based on Java Netbeans and MySQL

# INTRODUCTION

*The Advent of communication technology and computer technology has created wonders for common man. In order to connect to a database from within an application, we need a frame work that helps us send and execute SQL statement from within the application code. If we want to connect to a relational database (MYSQL) from within a Java application, we can do it using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API of Java.*

*In this project, we are going to learn how we can establish database connection from our Java Applications and process the retrieved data. This Application is used by online retailing for maintaining the records of Computer Hardware Items. Here we have discussed about the functioning of a Computer Hardware Store. In a Computer Hardware Store consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product’s availability and pricing at different e -retailers.*

*The advantage to a user is that it allows access to the facilities via the Internet, online, from the comfort of their home, office, car etc. Customers can shop online using different Computer Hardware devices such as, desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones. This type of search engine requires online transactions involving money, and, provides information to interact via filling forms. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm’s range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices.*

# SCOPE
• Computer Hardware Store maintains the records of the computer Hardware Items.
• It can be used by the retailer by using its User Id & Password.
• Through this retailer can easily select the item for sale and to maintain the records.
• It ensures availability of different popular brands and several products under one roof.
• It is very convenient.

*Improvement*
• With the advancement of technology, it needs to be updated as per the requirement.
• To prove himself, retailer has to make necessary changes in his application.

*Future Scope*
• In terms of future scope, a variety of data connectivity techniques can be used to maintain the record and to increase the sale.
• It can improve accuracy and work efficiency.
